    about: >+
      The **Bright Beginnings** project works with vulnerable young parents
      under 25 who are pregnant or have a child under 2, offering support
      focused on improving both parental and infant health. The project derived
      from the Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) in Southampton, with the idea of
      providing similar support to parents who would not typically meet the FNP
      criteria. Designed to give parents a trusted, knowledgeable adult, No
      Limits assign one to one support to parents, either through a paid youth
      worker or a volunteer, a ‘befriender’.


      Acting as a ‘community grandparent’, befrienders give parenting guidance and advice, help to navigate community services and resources as well as being a consistent presence in a parent’s life. This enables parents to look after both their own physical and emotional health and that of their child. Befrienders may guide parents through various processes and paperwork they need to go through as new parents, for example immunisations for their child. With the addition of paid youth workers to the model as a result of a large number of referrals, No Limits can now provide more regular and proactive support to parents, especially around safeguarding.


      In addition, **Bright Beginnings** now offers a training course, Gro Brain, for parents who are pregnant or have a child under 1, aiming to help develop emotionally healthy infants. Most referrals come from within No Limits, but parents can also be referred by children’s services or health visitors. The intention is to extend the project to young parents who are isolated and do not have family support to assist with the development of parenting skills.

    how: >-
      * Create a secure, generic email address for receiving requests instead of
      using an individual’s account. This provides a consistent process that
      won’t be disrupted by staff transition or vacation time.

      * Make your request form computer-friendly. Turn your current form into a fillable PDF, Web form, or a standard Microsoft Word document. Paper forms have to be completed and scanned, creating additional barriers to submitting them — and then for reading them.

      * Provide an online portal for accepting background check requests as part of any future system modernization efforts.

    about: >
      Developed and funded by the Tasmanian government, **Bringing Baby Home**
      is an early intervention pilot programme providing intensive support to
      parents of infants classified as ‘at-risk’ to help prevent entry into the
      care system. As part of the programme, not-for-profit organisations like
      Key Assets Australia in Tasmania deliver a range of bespoke services with
      the aim of increasing parents’ capacity to parent safely. As part of an
      intensive, time-limited programme, parents are afforded the opportunity to
      develop their childcare skills while actively parenting full time within a
      supervised and supportive environment. 


       


      In Tasmania, Key Assets Australia work with parents in their homes across a 12-week period. During the first four weeks, monitoring, support and coaching is provided 24/7 in the home by a small team of Key Assets practitioners and key members of the family’s personal support network. The model includes a range of elements; from comprehensive assessment to familial network development, counselling, targeted parenting education, emotional and practical support, advocacy and a respite care service. In some cases where the baby cannot be cared for in the home, parents and infant may be accommodated by a residential service.  Key Assets Australia’s **Bringing Baby Home Service** will partner with the residential service to provide Parenting Education and support transition and in-home support where suitable. 


       


      Although a formal evaluation of the pilot is yet to take place, there are indications that the programme helps to reduce risk through stabilising mental health, the implementation of harm minimisation practices, new knowledge and skills, safety plans and better support networks. There is also evidence that the programme allows babies to remain in their homes, with the support of wider networks.  An external pilot evaluation is expected and Key Assets are exploring potential opportunities to work with parents prior to birth. 
    how: >-
      * Ask prospective foster families if they’ve lived out-of-state during
      your initial meeting with them — or even before, when you can.

      * Find the relevant Adam Walsh/out-of-state background check forms, either in your state or county’s Adam Walsh database or on the other state’s website.

      * Take a laptop to orientation for people interested in being foster parents and help them fill out online background check forms.

      * Take paper background check forms and make sure people understand how to fill them out.

      * If any of the background check forms require notarization, arrange for a volunteer notary to attend orientation and sign off on multiple forms at once.
    outcome: We’re still collecting concrete data. But we believe that this will
      shorten the time it takes to approve foster families who’ve lived out of
      state.

      Dream, Believe, Succeed is an in-school and extracurricular programme that
      seeks to divert young people away from serious violence through offering a
      curriculum of inspiring, creative experiences. The project, which won the
      CYPN Youth Work Award in 2022, is a partnership between a number of local
      organisations in Edmonton. This early intervention programme is
      specifically designed to align with the interests and ambitions of the
      young people it supports and provides a safe space for them to express
      their concerns or anxieties related to gangs and youth violence. Youth
      mentors work with young people through both one-to-one and group sessions.
      The sessions involve creative arts elements, for example, drama, role play
      or spoken word, and workshops are also delivered by industry experts,
      including artists, musicians and filmmakers. The programme aims to offer
      guidance to young people on how they may approach certain scenarios and
      make positive choices. Other aspects include working with the British DJ
      and MC Academy to develop a radio station presented by children for
      children and there is an additional family intervention aspect. To further
      elevate the educational experiences of at-risk youth, Dream, Believe,
      Succeed also facilitates 'Closing the Gap' math workshops, with the goal
      of levelling up their academic abilities and preparing them for the world
      ahead. At the end of the programme, there is a production at a local
      theatre produced by the children involved.


      In Edmonton, the programme is delivered across 18 schools, including both primary and secondary schools, a Pupil Referral Unit (PRU) and a special needs college. https://edmontoncommunitypartnership.org/projects/dream/

    title: Early-Intervention-and-Prevention-Model
    about: >
      Birmingham City Council, supported by EY as a strategic partner, have
      pioneered an Early Intervention & Prevention (EI&P) approach in light of a
      council-wide corporate priority to shift focus


      and investment from crisis to prevention. The model seeks to enable staff to support citizens more upstream, to help them build resilience and independence, with a focus on those at risk of domestic abuse, homelessness and poverty. It follows the theory that through intervening early, people are less likely to escalate to a crisis stage, leading to better outcomes for the person or family and the council are able to avoid more costly statutory intervention. In Birmingham, this whole council shift was preceded by previous work in adult’s services to move towards greater investment in prevention within communities and the development of a strengths-based, locality-based model of social work.


      Birmingham’s EI&P model, which was co-produced with a range of local stakeholders, moves away from considering the issues individuals or families face in isolation, for example as simply children’s services related or simply housing-related, and instead looks at the whole picture of what an individual or family is facing over their life course. It focuses on identifying both the risk factors and the protective factors that can stop a family or individual escalating to requiring a higher level of statutory intervention, with prevention focused around providing activities, signposting and support that can prevent the issue from arising in the first place.


      Birmingham’s citizen-centric model focuses on enabling independence and supporting citizens to be economically and socially active across their lives. Through developing a coherent prevention pathway, the model leverages and encourages collaboration between a range of council, community and voluntary sector, and wider public sector partner services to allow people to be directed to the right place in the system at the right time for them. It also utilises the capacity in the community to offer support in more accessible and familiar settings.


      Crucial to the model is a strong focus on data and insight and pooling data from multiple council sources to develop an integrated view of the citizen, so that resources can be directed to ensure the most appropriate support or signposting can be delivered. Birmingham are at the start of their data journey but there is an ambition to embed a predictive element of analytics to identify families requiring support in an automated way.


      To date a key focus of the model in the context of the cost of living has been to look at supporting citizens who may be financially vulnerable to develop financial resilience and enable them to remain in secure housing, via a ‘Homes and Money Advice’ offer. This includes a more human-centric approach to supporting individuals in arrears, for example sending a Whatsapp message and offering a call to explore support options, rather than the traditional approach of sending a letter.


      As part of this work, in 2023 the Council undertook a 6-week pilot, using a data-driven ‘nudge’ tool to support 39 individuals and families who were at risk of requiring statutory intervention. The pilot focused on supporting access to the council’s wider Homes & Money Hub offer, using customer contact data to identify where customers had applied for some elements of cost of living support but not others despite being eligible. Through proactive engagement, Birmingham’s advisors were able to help the cohort claim an additional £94,000 in benefits and welfare. Modelling also suggested that 17 out of the 39 individuals were registered as disabled but not known to adult social care and through supporting this cohort to maintain financial resilience and remain outside of adult social care, there was an associated cost avoidance of £1.32m per annum.


      With initial promising results, the model is showing the value to citizens and council services of a supportive and dedicated approach to working with citizens early on and in a proactive manner.

    heading: Family Group Conferences at Pre-Proceedings Stage
    about: >
      Family Group Conferences (FGCs) involve the family leading a meeting of a
      child’s family, friends and network to come up with a plan to keep a child
      safe. A long-established and widespread practice deriving from New
      Zealand, it acknowledges the value of the family being central to the
      decision-making process for a child. Children may play a part in their own
      family group conference and the process is coordinated and supported by an
      independent coordinator.


      A recent large-scale evaluation led by Coram and Foundations- the first of its kind- has demonstrated the impact of FGCs at the pre-proceedings stage. Supported by the charity Daybreak, the evaluation involved a randomised controlled trial, process evaluation and cost analysis, and considered the key factors in successfully delivering the approach and the impact on outcomes for children and families. A total of 2,500 children and almost 1,500 families took part across 21 local authorities, with half of the families receiving this intervention and the other half continuing to receive the standard local authority service. The evaluation found that in the twelve months after the pre-proceedings letter was issued, children whose families were referred for an FGC were less likely to enter care, with just over a third (36.2%) going into care after being referred to an FGC, compared to almost half (44.8%) of those who were not referred for an FGC. They were also less likely to have care proceedings issued and 6 months later, they had been in care for less time than those who were not referred for an FGC. There were no statistically significant differences in factors such as how included parents felt in their child’s care planning or whether children’s living arrangements had changed, however.


      The evaluation also indicated that cost savings of using FGC, with £960 being saved per child referred in the first year. The analysis found that if the approach was implemented across England, over 2,000 fewer children would enter care every year, with estimated savings of over £150 million in two years. The evaluation recommended the use of this approach more widely across the country, especially where it is delivered to a high-quality and complemented by other longer-term intervention. This evidences the value of adopting an early intervention approach to FGCs in helping to keep families together. https://foundations.org.uk/our-work/reports/family-group-conferencing/

      When you connect with a youth’s kin, make it a point to The Focused
      Deterrence programme is being trialled across five English cities
      following a £7 million investment by the Home Office and Youth Endowment
      Fund. The project is aimed at deterring young people from violence. The
      programme originated in Boston in the USA where it was developed in
      response to growing gun violence, with suggestions that it can lead to a
      33% decrease in crime. It has been adopted successfully across the UK.


      The approach involves police, local councils, community organisations, health services, schools, colleges and probation services working together to identify those aged 14 and over involved in or at risk of becoming involved in serious violence. Tailored support is then delivered, including


      mentoring, facilitation of education, employment and training opportunities, mental health and housing support.


      The programme aims to reduce violence by identifying and addressing the underlying causes of violence and working together with communities to prevent it. It is being led by Violence Reduction Units or Networks in Coventry and Wolverhampton, Nottingham, Leicester and Manchester.


      The programme began in May 2023 and will run until August 2025, with the University of Hull conducting an evaluation of the programme across the five cities. https://youthendowmentfund.org.uk/news/the-home-office-and-youth-endowment-fund-invest-7-million-in-focused-deterrence/

      For Baby’s Sake is a programme working therapeutically with families to
      break the cycle of domestic abuse and give babies the best start in life.
      Both parents join For Baby’s Sake during pregnancy, whether together as a
      couple or not, and are supported individually (each by their own
      Practitioner) up until the baby’s second birthday. The programme’s
      trauma-informed and attachment focused approach provides parents with what
      they want and need to make changes for themselves and their baby. They are
      empowered not to be defined by their past, and to become the parent and
      person they want to be. The therapeutic content and trusting relationship
      each parent builds with their practitioner, underpinned by robust
      multi-agency safeguarding, are key change mechanisms for achieving
      positive outcomes for all family members. Parents testify that the ‘inner
      child’ therapeutic core supports them ‘make peace with the past’ while the
      attachment-focused parenting content, including Video Interaction
      Guidance, supports parents to provide attuned, sensitive parenting and
      support their baby’s social, emotional and cognitive development, building
      foundations for learning, school readiness and life-long resilience.


      Babies develop well, emotionally, socially and cognitively, in line with low risk groups. Other outcomes include reduced domestic abuse, improvements in parents’ emotional regulation and wellbeing, improved engagement with children’s services and other agencies and reduced safeguarding needs. A major evaluation by King’s College London, published in 2020, found For Baby’s Sake to be the first programme to address key limitations in whole-family responses to domestic abuse. For Baby’s Sake is influencing national understanding of what works. It won the 2021 Centre for Justice Innovation award for Family Justice. The programme won the CYPNow Safeguarding award for the partnership in Blackpool. Other areas where the programme operates include Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire, Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea. For Baby’s Sake featured in two National Safeguarding Practice Panel reports (notably for engaging fathers) and in Foundations (What Works for Children and Families) reports as one of few particularly promising programmes for children and families affected by DA. https://www.forbabyssake.org.uk/the-programme/

      Building on its established history in the social housing space, Grosvenor
      has established Grosvenor Hart Homes (GHH). GHH is a new social enterprise
      seeking to improve the life chances of vulnerable children, young people
      and families by providing high-quality, affordable homes alongside
      bespoke,


      wrap-around support services, focusing on employment and wellbeing support. The initiative is premised on the understanding that a safe and secure home is fundamental to stability and that from this foundation, holistic support can boost individual and familial wellbeing, economic security and longer term prospects. A key feature of the model is the role of a ‘Family Assistant’, helping to coordinate access to the GHH service model and services offered by external partners, building strong, trusted relationship with tenants.


      GHH is developing a 3-year proof of concept in the Chester area, with a small number of newly renovated homes. It is specifically aimed at supporting cohorts including care leavers, young people at risk of NEET and ‘vulnerable’ families, including those affected by mental health, trauma and domestic violence. In addition, a number of properties are available as affordable housing to those on the council’s housing register and as market rent properties, contributing to the development of a balanced community.


      GHH has worked closely with the local authority to ensure the model aligns with and complements existing council priorities and processes. This has included the local authority helping to shape the suite of services designed locally and the GHH housing allocation process, supporting the identification of and assessment of suitable tenants via an innovative multi-agency matching panel. GHH has appointed specialist service design agencies, Dartington Service Design Lab and Engine Service Design, to design the range of evidence-based services offered, with continued input from both potential service users and national and local experts from the public, private and third sector. With the Family Assistant acting as a navigator, other services being developed include mental health and wellbeing support and life skills training, as well as a jobs brokerage and employment support service, which includes a business incubator. There is also an on-site flexible workspace, the Grosvenor Hart Hub, which is accessible both to tenants and the wider community. All of these services have been designed to integrate with and adapt to the local context.


      The model will undergo continued iteration and improvement over the proof-of-concept period, informed by service users, best practice and capitalising on emerging technology, to ensure it is delivering on its ambition to provide high-quality services that enhance the life chances of children, young people and families. Over the next 10 years, GHH is looking to provide more than 750 homes in the north-west as well as in central London, aiming to create a model which can be scaled for wider benefit. https://www.grosvenor.com/social-enterprise-7c340789406fcc48b14e0b99aff29a81

      You can use a genogram tool like the ones we list below or simply a blank
      piece of paper or dry-erase board. Here are some tips:


      * Start making a family tree to show a child’s connections. 

      * Include all important connections, even if they aren’t legal or blood relatives.

      * Use the tree to generate new leads and to keep track of your contacts and progress.

      * [The Extreme Family Finding Project](https://www.fosteradopt.org/family-permanency/extreme-family-finding/) — which has a 95% success rate — recommends a genogram have at least 150-200 people on it.


      There are some additional tools that staff may consider using. These tools are helpful on their own, but work best when coupled with a genogram: 


      * [Accurint](https://www.accurint.com/): Records search from LexisNexis. 

      * [TLOxp](https://www.tlo.com/) (The Last One): Records search from TransUnion, one of the three credit bureaus. 

      * [Find a Grave](https://www.findagrave.com/): This tool can be helpful for completing genograms.
    costs:
      - Genogram software (optional, but helpful)
    benefits:
      - Find more kin who can take placement and/or serve as lifelong support
        for vulnerable youth
      - Find some kin your agency would not otherwise find
      - Makes it easy for multiple workers to collaborate on a child’s
        supportive network, and to follow up with those connections over time

    about: >
      MAiming to support maternal mental health, early childhood development and
      family wellbeing, Lullaby Project involves new mothers working with
      professional musicians to write a personal lullaby for their baby. The
      Lullaby model was originally introduced in New York’s Carnegie Hall to
      support mothers in healthcare settings, homeless shelters, high schools
      and in prisons. Musicians are trained by a Teaching Artist from Carnegie
      Hall. Linked to a wider social prescribing programme, during the project,
      the parent is supported to write a letter to their baby, which forms the
      basis for a song which is co-developed with a musician and which harnesses
      the creativity of the parent. The songs is then recorded and given to the
      parent for their baby. Songs have been written in a number of languages,
      with a diverse range of parents taking part. The key objectives are to
      develop parental self-confidence and wellbeing, enhance child development,
      bring together communities and address health inequalities. The project
      now works acros


      Liverpool and South West Yorkshire, as well as at sites in Wales. Live Music Now is working with the Institute of Cultural Capital in Liverpool to develop an evaluation framework. The findings from the New York project indicate an impact in terms of reaching families in need, building connections between caregivers and babies, enhancing the child’s language, social and communication skills. https://www.livemusicnow.org.uk/lullaby-project/

      * Redesign your planning meeting invitation - The invitation should serve
      as a prompt and remind staff to invite as many supportive adults as they
      can, ideally three times as many supportive adults as paid staff members. 

      * Redesign your meeting sign in sheet - Provide enough room for supportive adults to sign in for in-person meetings. For example, you might have four times as many lines in the “supportive adult” area than in the “staff” area. 

      * Ask youth about supportive adults in their lives - Staff should make sure that supportive adults are aware of and invited to planning meetings. You might even ask youth to suggest a supportive adult themselves. 

      * Keep track of meeting attendance - With a simple spreadsheet, you can keep track of the breakdown of roles at planning meetings. Use this information to keep track of progress towards the goal of having three times as many supportive adults as paid staff in attendance. * Keep asking about supportive adults as new goals arise - A youth may have one or more supportive adults who generally attend meetings, but may have an additional support for a specific goal, such as practicing for a driving test, getting mentoring in math, or shopping for a prom dress.

        simple Excel spreadsheet, with regular exports from their IT system.

        * **Ohio** has Youth Centered Permanency Round Tables (YCPRT) running in several counties. For YCPRTs, the youth is asked to bring a support person to the meeting. It can be anyone: a caregiver, a friend of the family, a member of the family, or anyone the youth feels is supportive of them. That can also initiate more conversations and discussion about permanency options and supports for the youth. One youth asked his fast food manager to come with him, and the manager didn’t even know he was in foster care. The manager ended up adopting him!

        * In **Ohio**, the practice for maintaining connections is: any youth 14 and over is able to have two support persons join in on the family team meetings and case plan meetings. That helps to initiate discussion of any other support persons available to the child. * **Hawaii** develops [Youth Circles](/assets/HawaiiCircleBrochure.pdf) for each child, which includes working with each youth to identify the supportive adults who will be invited to the circle. 

        * **New Hampshire** identifies up to 45 of a youth's supports through Permanency Pact through Foster Club, and involves them in meetings to accomplish specific goals, such as buying a first car, attending holiday celebrations after aging out of care, etc. As adults are identified, the agency sends those adults invites and supportive materials to support these goals.

    about: >
      Being placed in kinship care can often be a more stable placement for
      youth when compared to placement in a group home or foster home with other
      unrelated youth. By staying Blackpool Better Start have implemented a
      Speech, Language and Communication (SLC) Triage Panel to improve early
      identification of and support for children with speech, language and
      communication needs. It was formed in 2020 in order to identify local
      children who were not accessing language assessments and interventions.
      This panel comprises of a multi-agency team, including an NHS SLC
      therapist, an SLC Therapist from the commissioned service ‘Communicate’,
      the local authority Early Years Team Manager, a literacy advisory teacher,
      a Community Connector from Blackpool Better Start and is Chaired by The
      Early Years Senior Manager. Meeting every two weeks, the panel considers
      new referrals and discusses the next steps for children as they approach
      the end of their interventions. Referrals come from both health and
      pre-schools, usually after a child’s WellComm Assessment. Following
      referral, a Community Connector is assigned to each family and as part of
      an informal phone conversation, they help them to understand what the
      panel will involve, as well as finding out more about the child, family
      and any challenges accessing services. This can include factors such as
      digital poverty or complex needs of children and other family members.
      This information is then fed back to the panel, allowing them to
      understand the type of interventions that would be helpful and accessible
      to the family considering their individual circumstances, to maximise the
      chance of successful engagement. After the panel, families receive a
      letter proposing the next steps and the Community Connector briefs the
      family on what will happen next. Across the intervention period, the
      Community Connector will stay in touch with the family. Following the
      intervention, the panel discuss the child’s case again and propose next
      steps based on the child’s individual circumstances.


      Between April 2022 and March 2023, this multi-agency approach has received 631 referrals with 461 families (73%) receiving Community Connector Support. Every child referred into the panel receives a Speech, Language and Communication support Pack out together by the Community Connectors which contains bespoke information and advice and a book donated by either The National Literacy Trust, The Book Trust or The Centre for Early Child Development.

      though this term has fallen out of use.

      * By asking about connections repeatedly over time, you can include important relationships that a youth has developed since entering care, too.

      The Raising Rochdale SEND Team is a multi-agency alliance that aims to
      improve support and outcomes for children and young people with Special
      Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) in Rochdale, United Kingdom. The
      project was initiated in January 2021, with the support of the Council for
      Disabled Children (CDC), to create an integrated service for children and
      young people with SEND. This was a departure from the previous system,
      which worked in siloes.


      Prioritising the outcomes of children and young people and in collaboration with families, the alliance has scoped out early intervention offers to identify gaps and patterns and put in place a robust information sharing system, as well as establishing clear outcomes and measures. As a result, the number of children receiving early intervention and support has grown, and more professionals


      are accessing training. The waiting times for an autism diagnosis and support have also reduced, and three new peer-led projects are in development.


      The Raising Rochdale SEND Team won the Public Sector Children’s Team Award at the Children and Young People Now Awards 2022, recognising the work to implement an Outcomes-Based Accountability (OBA) approach to commissioning and enhance support and outcomes for 5,913 children and young people who require SEND support.

      Fewer youth will enter group homes if there is a team dedicated to finding
      alternative placements. A red team should be a diverse group of agency
      staff, who conduct kin research, construct a genogram, and ask youth
      directly about possible placements. The team should be empowered to
      rapidly brainstorm, make decisions, and Talking Transitions focuses on
      improving speech and language skills, aiming to ease the transition to
      primary school for children. The programme is in its fifth year, having
      expanded across the Southend region. With the intention of building
      relationships between providers, the scheme involves the creation of a
      number of ‘satellites’ combining local schools and early years settings
      (pre-school, day nurseries and childminders), each with expertise in early
      communication and language. The providers in each satellite collaborate
      closely to develop and deliver a range of fun experiences and activities
      for children, designed to support their emotional wellbeing, speech,
      language and communication.


      Key parts of the model include the ‘Learning Together’ component, involving a 10-week accredited Elklan speech and language course for feeder settings and schools focused on 3-5 year olds facilitated jointly by health and education teams. The ‘Working Together’ element provides a chance for those in each satellite to have a detailed discussion about children transitioning from early years to schools, both in terms of their personalities and overall strengths and difficulties, informed by findings from the child’s WellComm assessment. Following this session, strategies are devised for both parents and schools to follow, underpinned by a shared language. Lastly, as part of ‘Being together’ activities where primary schools and early years settings come together to create a programme of summer events at the child’s new school, which focus on communication and language. At these events, children come together with their parents, carers and families and simple


      strategies and themed activities to support language and communication are modelled. In addition, as part of the transition, teachers visit early years settings and the model integrates with the Family Centres over the summer holidays, offering Stay and Play sessions to keep the families engaged in the programme. The school SENDCO may also attend the Family Centre to get to know the child prior to them starting school.


      Talking Transitions won the CYPN Early Years award in 2022, with judges commending the manner in which it enhanced relationships between schools and early years providers, equipped professionals through specialist training and boosted knowledge among parents. Feedback from participants has also been positive, with headteachers remarking on the value of transition events and the increase in attendance from parents as a result of the activity-based approach to building speech and language skills. It has reached over 1,000 families to date and Talking Transitions hopes to broaden its reach so more children are able to receive speech and language support and benefit from a smoother, more coordinated transition to school.

      charity Power The Fight, takes a preventative, whole systems approach,
      offering a range of consultancy, training, workshops, supervision and
      reflective practice. The TIP team includes psychologists, youth

      approaches and expertise to the programme and ensure that young people
      from diverse backgrounds feel able to access the support. One key focus of

      programme, including, for example, cultural sensitivity training for
      teachers and staff. It seeks to embed a longer-term therapeutic approach
      across the system. An evaluation of the delivery of the approach in two
      schools and one alternative provision setting in South London over a 12
      month period highlighted positive findings of the approach. TIP was also
      innovative in its approach to data collection, adapting assessments to
      individual children and their needs, with one approach being for a child

      Findings include improvements in wellbeing scores, better understanding of
      mental health, coping mechanisms and self-regulation and better engagement
      in school or alternative


      provision and prevention of exclusion. Improvements were also noted in staff wellbeing, as well as evidence increased cultural sensitivity and inclusivity and better partnerships.


      From September 2023, TIP will be delivered in three secondary schools that are all part of the same school trust which will enable the programme to be tested at a trust wide level, with more opportunity to develop the system change aspects of the work. Power The Fight continue to share their learning with the youth, education and therapeutic sectors through regular research reports that are available on the website and it is hoped that, in the future, this learning element will become more embedded through partnerships with other organisations who might want to take a similar approach to addressing youth violence and increasing access to culturally sensitive, therapeutic support.

      at risk of homelessness or interaction with the criminal justice system,
      and parental or personal mental health issues.


      Reflecting the whole-council approach which centres prevention rather than crisis, the new Transitions and Preparation for Adulthood Service merges these two services with a new tiered offer to young people aged 14-25. This continues to offer support to those with complex needs but also has an offer for young people who do not meet statutory thresholds but have factors impacting their ability to live independently both the short-term and longer-term. This might include those struggling with isolation, poor physical or mental health, difficulty accessing employment, those at risk of homeless or exploitation. The service works collaboratively with young people for a maximum of six months via an integrated multi-agency approach, involving one-to-one coaching, goal setting, group work and signposting and connection to other services. It centres on four key areas: employability and financial independence, independent living, health and wellbeing and friendship, relationships and community inclusion.


      This unique approach has been widely commended, with the PFA service recognised as an example of good practice in a recent Department of Health and Social Care report on the importance of transitional safeguarding within adult social work. Outcomes of the PFA service included young people supported finding employment, housing, friendship and being able to better access health service and it is hoped these outcomes will be replicated among the wider group accessing this service.


      The new combined service follows an invest to save model, and it expected to save the council £2.3m by March 2025. It is expected that this cohort will need less system support later down the line. By intervening early, the Transitions and Preparation for Adulthood Service aims to improve life outcomes for those it supports, increasing resilience, independence and economic and social wellbeing and improve quality of life.

      aims to standardize the approach to identifying needs earlier and
      improving outcomes for children and young people. It is part of the SEND
      Transformation in Hertfordshire. The tool and training are available to
      professionals including education, health, and social care teams, and any
      other professionals who may come into contact with VSEND through the
      course of their usual work. The VSEND tool and approach establish a common
      language when describing levels of need and enable planning of how to meet
      needs. It supports the work of professionals and promotes collaboration
      between staff and parents. It also supports the child by enabling tracking
      of progress made and supporting annual review and transition planning. The
      tool enables settings and professionals to build a peer support network
      and share best practice and support strategies. It supports settings to
      identify gaps and areas for further development (resource / budget
      allocation, training, and recruitment).


      The VSEND training programme provides professionals with a better understanding of what the VSEND tool and approach is, how and when they might come across VSEND in their role, and how VSEND can support their role. The programme also offers a range of resources such as VSEND prompts and assessment statements, guidance slides for navigating the tool, and a printable sheet for parents. The programme has several key benefits, including establishing a common language when describing levels of need, enabling planning of how to meet needs, supporting the work of professionals, promoting collaboration between staff and parents, and supporting the child by enabling tracking of progress made and supporting annual review and transition planning.

    title: Beyond-the-Banter
    about: >
      Awarded the prize for Early Intervention at the CYPN awards in 2022,
      Beyond the Banter was a peer-led project, seeking to empower Black men and
      boys to have important conversations with peers across communities about
      mental health. Recognising the value of peer support to boost engagement,
      the programme trained Peer Educators and equipped them with the skills to
      open up


      conversations about emotional and mental wellbeing and encourage boys to get help if they need it. Although they received Mental Health First Aid training, Peer Educators are not experts in mental health but were guided and supported to safely and meaningfully share their experiences and stories to aid better understanding of wellbeing and the help available, and build resilience among a cohort who are statistically more likely to have had experiences impacting their wellbeing due to many factors, especially those related to racism and racial trauma. A key first step of the training programme for Peer Educators was for them to receive psychologist coaching to help them understand their own experiences to better help others. Across the community, Peer Educators planned and hosted workshops, as well as working alongside community partner organisations. Among the cohort receiving the intervention, 75% said they would start having more conversations about mental health and wellbeing with their family and friends.


      The peer-led approach was piloted between September 2021 and March 2022 in London. It was developed by Safer London on the background of extensive experience working with young Black men and boys and acknowledging the specific challenges this cohort faces. The Peer Educators, who referred to themselves as the ‘Mind the Mandem’ cohort, had lived experience of the challenges faced by young Black men and boys, and were recruited through an innovative recruitment process, which made use of video applications to get a feel for the potential Peer Educator as a person. The Peer Educators were also later provided with support to consider and pursue their future employment. A helpful professional’s guide has been developed to share the process, learning and encourage the approach to be adopted more widely.

    title: Embedding-Inclusion-Equity-and-Anti-Racism-in-Children’s-Services
    about: >
      Laurelle Brown Training and Consultancy (LBTC) collaborates with
      children’s services to develop and embed equity and inclusion across
      systems by developing practice, equipping leaders and enhancing system
      capacities through change. Founder, Laurelle, has a long background
      working in and alongside children’s services and completed a Churchill
      Fellowship exploring foster carer for adolescents with ‘complex needs’.


      The team co-create sustainable solutions to complex inequalities challenges faced by local authorities, and other organisations, by providing four core services:


      (1) Learning and development activities to enhance knowledge and understanding of barriers and enablers to equity and inclusion change, and capacity to mobilise progress - Training, coaching, mentoring, train the trainer programmes and leadership development.


      (2) Facilitation of opportunities, processes, and events to listen, inspire, and reflect for the planning and delivery of equity and inclusion change - Stakeholder participation and engagement, away days, consultations, equality impact assessments and reflective and listening spaces.


      (3) Change and transformation to embed equity and inclusion across systems, leadership and practice - Change projects and programmes, reviews, audits, strategies, service design and governance.


      (4) Evidence and insight collation, generation and dissemination as a lever for wider systems impact and learning - Evaluations, research and reports.


      All work is underpinned by the fundamental frameworks of anti-racism, intersectionality and systems thinking.


      One local authority project included a comprehensive Anti-Racism audit children’s social care to support the identification of opportunities to improve systems, practice and children and family outcomes and embed equity, inclusion and anti-racism. The audit included stakeholder focus groups and a survey, workforce data analysis and a review of children’s files, service and organisational strategies, policies and plans, and evidence and research. Key recommendations included improvements to the commissioning and quality assurance frameworks, establishing clear metrics and goals for equity, inclusion and anti-racism, integrating these into audit, commissioning and staff training materials and processes; as well as review and development of the Resilience practice model to ensure anti-racist principles and approaches and the impact of structural inequalities for minoritised children, families and staff were referenced and supporting inclusive practice. There was also a range of learning and development activity delivered, including a bespoke training programme to enhance knowledge and confidence of the senior leadership team, a new ‘Confident conversations on race’ induction course for all staff and a train the trainer course for staff to facilitate listening circles to support racialised staff.


      In another local authority, LBTC co-developed a tailored learning and development programme for children’s social care managers and senior leaders to support implementation of a newly published Tackling Inequalities Strategy. LBTC developed and facilitated training sessions to build knowledge and understanding of managers of key concepts, and strategies they can implement to tackle inequalities, a practitioner service day to support continuity and buy-in, and a reflective workshops to advise, guide and support the senior leadership team in driving and embedding a complex change programme of this nature. The collaboration has led to new recruitment approaches being implemented with positive representation and diversity results, the introduction of new programmes to engage staff and hold Heads of Service to account for equalities change and improved outcomes for minoritised children.

      assistance. Examples of benefits include: TANF, SNAP, unemployment
      insurance, social security, and VA benefits. 

      * Customize the application assistance and instructions for your area, such as providing necessary translations. 

      * Conduct a parallel process and carry out the licensing process while families are still working to meet the financial requirements. You can complete many steps, like background checks and home study interviews, even if a family member is still working to access additional financial benefits. 

      * Waive the financial requirement for relative placements on a case-by-case basis. Many child welfare systems have an exemption process that allows licensors to bypass the financial requirements for a relative placement if the placement is in the best interests of the child. 

      * Make sure that an exemption process is well-documented and easy for new licensors to learn and follow. 

      * Set a policy eliminating financial requirements for relative placements. There are no minimum financial requirements set by the federal government for foster parents, only that “applicants must be financially stable to meet their family’s needs prior to placing a foster child in the home.” Your state can modify licensing requirements to eliminate asking relative placements for financial information. However, we still believe ensuring the financial stability of traditionally licensed foster homes is a good practice.

If your agency uses [Binti](https://binti.com/), you can provide an online orientation video for families to watch. Afterwards, families can complete a quiz in order to get credit.

      * Convert your own in-person training to online training. If you prefer to use your own training instead of an existing online training, you can convert your materials. 

      * Follow promising practices for online training. In developing their own online training, Michigan identified several promising practices: 

        * Offer an online option for families to connect with one another. You can create a closed Facebook group for each class to help participants build connections and form a support group.
        * Schedule frequent classes. For two-parent households, this will allow parents to more easily switch between attending the training and spending time with children.
        * Keep classes short. A full-day class is often too long for many participants to do online. Build in short breaks throughout the class so that participants don’t disengage.
        * Set online meeting guidelines before the first class. Not all participants will be familiar with online meetings. Guidelines can include general expectations, online meeting manners (i.e. how to dress appropriately, when to mute), and instructions on using the technology. Leave time at the beginning of the meeting to assist with any technical difficulties.
        * Include an interactive element, such as a questionnaire for each session to make sure that parents understand the material as the trainer covers it. Cut any hands-on activities that can’t easily be done remotely. Instead, stop to discuss the material more often. 
        * Cap the class at approximately 20 people to make sure that everyone can engage. 
        * You can contact Jessica Sweet at Michigan DHHS if you have any questions ([SweetJ2@michigan.gov](mailto:SweetJ2@michigan.gov)).

      An instructive report published in 2021 highlighted key findings around a lack of fair and equal progression opportunities for BSPs as well as a sense that they faced career barriers as a result of their ethnicity. The report made six key recommendations for the sector. These included commissioning culturally competent independent resources to engage BSPs and provide a ‘safe’ forum to listen to and understand their workplace experiences, carry out workforce audits to assess workforce equality and progression opportunities, ringfenced funding for the commissioning/employment of dedicated ‘Equality, Diversity and Inclusion’ expertise, ringfenced leadership opportunities for BSPs, investment in high-quality learning and development opportunities for BSPs as well as implementing support for BSPs which addresses health inequalities.

      * **Collect critical items.** The most frequently needed items include
      fire extinguishers, oven locks, baby gates, first aid kits and medication
      lock boxes. There are several ways you may collect items like these:

        * You can collect donated items in new condition during a “safety inspection” drive, similar to a backpack or canned food drive. Here is sample language for a safety inspection drive.
        * You can work with local partners like churches to host a drive event or a fundraiser. 
        * You can use Family Preservation Service dollars, an existing budgetary tool that can help acquire needed items when used for direct placement. 
      * **Distribute critical items.** Your goal should be to make it as easy as possible for your team to distribute critical safety items to families in need. To do so, keep a stash of essentials in easy-to-access locations like a designated supply closet or the trunk of a case worker’s car. You can also provide key items at a foster parent training or orientation.
    costs:
      - Low to no cost to collect donated items
      - Cost of purchasing new safety items

      Centre is a transition service for children and families who have recently
      arrived in the area and the UK and have English as a second language. The
      programme works with children, parents and schools in an array of ways,
      offering resources and short courses for parents and carers, English as an
      Additional Language (EAL) development for children, as well as supporting
      transition into local schools (supported by effective data use) and
      providing EAL CPD opportunities for schools. The Centre seeks to create an
      inclusive, culturally diverse classroom, focusing on ensuring children can
      participate in a welcoming and supportive environment attuned to their
      needs. An initial strengths and needs assessment is undertaken so support
      can be put in place in schools as well as the facilitation of a
      multi-agency approach to support and skills development. It also supports
      families with other elements of settling, for example assisting with GP
      registration or home office liaison. The Centre supports up to 75 children
      through three classrooms covering KS1, KS2 and KS3. Children’s learning is
      structured


      around six cyclical Literacy units covering elements of multi-cultural Britain, as well as mathematics. All children arriving in Sandwell with EAL are required to attend the Centre and after they receive a school place, a STEPS Centre transition worker supports them to move into school.

      enterprise offering a range of support to professionals and young people
      involved in youth justice, with a focus on building anti-discriminatory
      practice. In the context of a correlation between unconscious racial bias
      and an over-representation of black and mixed heritage young men in the
      criminal justice system, the organisation provides anti-discriminatory
      practice training to youth justice teams, with topics including
      Unconscious Bias, Cultural Competency and Anti-Racism training. This has
      supported teams to acknowledge and address how unconscious bias may shape
      how they interact with young people. Through providing important training,
      development and upskilling opportunities, the initiative is also helping
      to address sector challenges related to recruitment and retention.


      The Wipers mentoring programme offers young people a crucial point of support to manage the transition from adolescence to adulthood, using a relationship-based, person-centred approach. Wipers mentors work with those at risk of criminal justice involvement, meeting young people at least once a week over three to six months. They engage with mentees in a range of ways, including partaking in activities and day trips as well as offering support to access local youth services and medical or professional appointments. The focus is on building self-esteem and confidence and helping them to navigate issues across their lives. Wipers report that for 88% of the young people receiving mentoring there has been an improvement in confidence and self-esteem.


      A further programme delivered by Wipers and funded by the London Violence Reduction Unit, the ‘Ether Programme’, provides support to young black and minority ethnic men involved in the criminal justice system. This is an eight session personal development and leadership programme and engages uses in issues around race, identity, self-esteem and confidence, as well as perceptions around masculinity and other stereotypes. https://www.wipers.org.uk/

      critical appointments which delays the licensing process and creates
      uWarwickshire County Council provide a Baby Box to new and expectant
      parents who are care leavers. The Baby Box is given to each baby and
      includes essential items like nappies, wipes, baby wash, clothes and a
      thermometer for the baby. There is an additional £200 baby fund to allow
      parents to buy more substantial items they need for the baby. The
      initiative was rolled out in Warwickshire in April 2020, allowing the
      service to maintain relationships with the young parents during Covid by
      dropping off the packages at their doors. Driven by a care experienced
      employee, the initiative aligns with the Council’s ‘Corporate Grandparent’
      responsibility, with an intention to


      support care leavers to look after their babies where they need it and allay fears among some care leavers that they may have their baby taken away.


      The boxes supplement a wider offer for care leaver parents, with Warwickshire putting on events on occasions like Mother’s Day and paediatric first aid training courses, with specialist cooking classes to support weaning also in train. There is also a Young Parents group. The team have also worked with the British Baby Box Company, who provide Baby Box to Scotland who provide baby boxes to every child born in Scotland, to develop Warwickshire’s offer, with a bigger box that the baby can lie and nap in and including a wider array of items. The local authority have now established work with a volunteer led project, Baby Basics Warwick, who will process referrals for the team.


      Warwickshire have supported almost 100 care leavers via this initiative to date, and they hope to engage more local businesses, through their baby box re-launch in January, to contribute so they can broaden the offer. The team have advised other local authorities on adopting a similar model. The project has the added benefit of helping the team to better understand the number of young care leavers who go on to have children, which has helped to improve the local support for care leavers. The initiative has both provided practical support to care leavers but has importantly created a culture of support and trust between this cohort and the local authority.

      Microsoft, in partnership with UBDS and three local authorities has
      launched a pilot programme to support care leavers across the country. The
      programme aims to provide 15 care leavers with a 12-week programme of
      mentoring, training, and career development.


      The programme is designed to be relevant, responsive, and empowering for the care leavers, involving them in co-producing and co-delivering the programme as well as being actively involved in the evaluation.


      The programme aims to have a positive impact on the well-being, quality of life, and social inclusion of the care leavers and their community. The programme will also enhance the collaboration and partnership between Microsoft and the local authorities in supporting care leavers and other disadvantaged groups.


      The care leavers will receive guidance, support, and encouragement from a mentor who works at Microsoft and has relevant skills and experience. They will also learn new skills and gain knowledge of career pathways that match their interests and aspirations. They will have the opportunity to participate in fun and meaningful activities and events, such as an ideation workshop and a hackathon,led by UBDS, where they can solve real-world problems and create solutions. They will also earn certifications (where appropriate) that can boost their CV and employability.


       The local authorities that are participating in the programme are Trafford Council, London Borough of Haringey, and Northampton Children’s Trust. Each local authority will select and refer 5 care leavers for the programme. The programme will run from January to April 2024.


      The pilot will be monitored and evaluated throughout, with the feedback and outcomes of the programme used to inform future programmes and initiatives for care leavers and other groups.

    about: >-
      Current CPR certification, training, pet vaccinations, and other
      requirements generally need to be renewed in order to renew a foster home
      license, but these specific renewal dates rarely line up with the overall
      foster home license renewal date. 


      Adding critical dates like CPR certification renewals, pet vaccination expirations, and additional training dates to your calendar and sending families quick, timely reminders will help ensure that families are all caught up when it’s time to renew their license.
    how: >-
      Add critical expiration and renewal dates to your calendar and turn on a
      reminder notification for 30-60 days ahead of each date. You may also
      suggest tracking these dates in your child welfare IT system. 


      Send a reminder to families via email, physical mail, text, or a shared calendar invite. When possible, ask families what their preferred mode of communication is and send a reminder that way.

    about: >-
      Many child welfare systems license hundreds of families that are only
      interested in adopting infants. These homes are not always needed and can
      take up valuable staff time and financial resources to license and
      maintain. 


      By updating your recruitment materials, messaging, and inquiry forms, you can highlight the real needs of your child welfare agency: foster families who will prioritize helping to reunify and heal a child’s family of origin or provide permanency for older youth and sibling groups. Case workers should have multiple conversations about potential families’ expectations and work to clarify that fostering is not the right choice for a family that is only looking to adopt an infant.
    how: >-
      

      * If you ask about placement preferences in your inquiry form, remove references to adoption. Draft email and letter templates to respond to families who are only interested in adoption, to redirect them to legally-free youth in need of families. 

      * Promotional materials about adoption should reflect the children who need adoptive homes. You can remove or replace any photos or references to babies and toddlers.

      Every child welfare system is looking for more families. Kinship

      relative caregivers to general licensed homes can make a big difference in
      the available pool of placement options. 


      Focus some recruitment efforts on existing relative caregivers. Make sure case workers discuss the idea of becoming a general licensed home with relative caregivers at regular points, particularly at permanency milestones like a return home.

      foster families that attract more families to sign up to foster.
    how: Start a recognition program. Even a certificate and a personal note can go
      a long way towards making a foster family feel valued and appreciated (and
      all their friends will see the certificate on the wall). You can also
      commission local businesses to donate free or discounted items as awards
      or gifts for current families.

The squads build camaraderies and help one another through challenges. Each year, there is a competition to see which squad recruits the most new families, with a ceremony and gift card prizes for the winning squad. 

        * Frederick County, MD hosts regular events for current foster families (pivoting them to Google Meet during the pandemic). They have also recognized foster families through a variety of events and strategies including: an annual adults-only reception for foster families (with free, on-site childcare); a drive through celebration where foster families who drove by the office could pick up ready to heat catered meals; drive by caravans where case workers and foster families drive by houses with signs and music; recognition baskets for foster families that included fun items like board games, puzzles, and snacks; welcome baskets for new foster families that include the Department handbook, a water bottle, mugs, and books for both parents and children. 

        * Ohio uses billboards to recognize individual foster families. Some families take friends and picnics to visit their billboard!

        * Indiana works with local businesses to make a variety of discounts and offers available for their foster families.

    about: >-
      When filling out a foster family inquiry form, most people default to
      saying they heard about fostering “from the website” or “online.” However,
      further questioning reveals they were really exposed through an event at
      their church, a family connection, a radio commercial, or other
      experience. 


      By capturing detailed information about how new foster families were referred to your agency, you can focus on the highest-yield recruitment methods and avoid accidentally stopping methods that were, in fact, successfully recruiting families.
    how: >-
      

      * Add to your inquiry forms a list of possible events, marketing materials, or other recruitment methods that someone may have been exposed to, and ask which ones interested the person completing the inquiry. 

      * Make sure you have “Other” on your list as well, with a space to freely enter text. Encourage detail by labeling this field “Other (please be specific). 

      * In initial phone calls, ask probing questions about how a family became interested in fostering. Add these details to a central location (like a shared spreadsheet) that can later be tracked.

This helped them realize that ValPack mailers were actually reaching a lot of families. 

        * Fairfax County, VA does not ask for referral information on its inquiry form, instead asking in the initial orientation phone call. They report that this provides richer and more detailed answers than a form. For instance, if a family says they heard about fostering on their website, staff can ask how they go to the website or if there was something in particular that caught their attention.

      Just because a family is not ready to foster today does not mean that they
      couldn’t be a strong placement option in the future. New data shows that
      it can take some families years between when they first take an interest
      in fostering and when they start an application. When systems delete or
      close out inquiries to meet short-term metrics like conversion rates, they
      also potentially lose out on a number of families who would have completed
      applications in the future. 


      Keep all your potential foster family inquiries open and find ways to keep families engaged with newsletters, email campaigns, and the occasional personal check-in. You can also keep interested families engaged by highlighting other ways for them to support foster youth, such as participating in a donation drive or volunteering at an event.
    how: >-
      

      * If your team maintains performance metrics around converting inquiries to applications, stop. Instead, focus on opportunities to encourage high-touch interactions with families, like phone calls or meetings, and ways to engage interested families in lower-level commitments like attending an event or participating in a donation drive. 

      * Identify ways to keep in touch with long-standing inquiries without taking up a lot of staff time, such as creating an automated email newsletter. 

      * Have a clear policy about what steps a family has to retake, and in what timeframe, if they begin part of the process but aren’t ready to complete it.

Many families take a long time to complete the application: more families take six or more months than the number of families who complete the application right away.

        * Fairfax County, VA keeps all inquiries open. They report that families can take an average of two to three years to move from an inquiry to an application. 

        * Washington, D.C. adds new inquiries to their newsletter and checks in with families quarterly. They do not close inquiries. They report that they sometimes have a family become licensed after being on their inquiry list for as long as a decade.

      Becoming a foster parent is a big step, and many potential foster parents
      need more human interaction to reassure them through the process. Call or
      meet with potential foster families when they submit an inquiry, instead
      of relying on automated emails and mailings. Speaking with potential
      families can help clarify expectations and get potential caregivers
      comfortable with moving to the next step. 


      Additionally, when there’s too much automation upfront, families for whom fostering is not a good fit can get far into the process before they have an opportunity to talk with a real person. By speaking with potential families early, you can help dissuade families for whom fostering is not a good fit (e.g. families only interested in adopting infants), so your agency can focus on the families that best meet the needs of your current youth.
    how: Look for opportunities to include a human interaction, such as a phone
      call, early in the inquiry process. If you don’t have the staff resources
      for this, consider hiring current foster parents to help.

    about: >-
      Filling out a form indicating interest in becoming a foster parent is a
      big step. When someone fills out an inquiry form, they might be ready to
      go right away, or they might need time and more information to think about
      making such a significant commitment. If too much time passes before they
      get a response, a potential caregiver may become discouraged, second guess
      themselves, or change their mind. 


      Set a required, short response time for following up with potential foster family inquiries. Responding quickly with more information makes you seem responsive and supportive to new families, gives primed applicants a way to get started and make a more informed choice about whether fostering is right for them, and can help weed out poor fits (e.g. families only looking to adopt infants). By providing information about additional ways to support foster youth, you can also help more hesitant families get and stay engaged.
    how: >-
      

      * Set a metric, ranging from one to seven days, for how quickly you will respond to new inquiries. This metric should be as short as possible, but realistic given your current staffing and resources. Track initial response times for new inquiries. If they begin to slip, work with your team to identify how to respond faster (such as increasing resources or using calendar reminders). 

      * Create an automated email with links to information on fostering. Consider adding tips for ways to support foster youth without becoming a foster parent. Provide a printed version for families who do not use email. 

      * Create a newsletter (email and/or print) to keep interested families engaged.

      * Create a calendar with reminders to check in with potential foster families. You can also use a task management app with date-based reminders to keep track of which families you need to check in with and when. Ideally, the entire team will share visibility across these lists, so if someone is out sick then another team member can cover their check-in calls.

    how: Track data from your inquiry form (like caregiver’s interests, tribal
      status, language spoken, or zip code) against the characteristics you most
      need in foster families. You can then prioritize licensing matching

      families, and employees.
    how: >-
      A comprehensive social media policy covers topics like: 

      * **Limiting accounts** — Provide official shared work accounts or have staff create  accounts that they only use for work. Don’t allow workers to use their personal accounts for family finding. 

      * **Confidentiality** — Don’t share private information through social media messages. Just as you would leave a generic voicemail when trying to identify kin, encourage social media contacts to reach out to you directly for follow-up. 

      * **Respecting family privacy** — If a public child welfare account were to “friend” a possible family member, that would publicly reveal that the family member is having an interaction with child welfare. Workers should not update profiles, post public messages, or “friend” other accounts when using official work accounts for family finding. 

      * **Making staffing decisions** — Decide if a central team will conduct social media family finding activities, or if all workers will be granted access. There are pros and cons to both approaches. 

      * **Requiring official cause** - Using social media should be _mandatory_ when looking for kin and when recruiting more foster families. At the same time, workers should not look up family members purely out of curiosity. 

      * **Handling records management** — As a government agency, your social media messages may be subject to things like public records requests. You can use tools to automatically archive all your official social media accounts. 

      * **Unblocking social media sites** — Management may have to meet with IT to have certain social media sites unblocked from the network. (Let us know if you need help with this!)

      kinship caregivers.
    how: >-
      * Review your privacy policy with current kinship caregivers to make it
      clear what they can and cannot post on social media. This can be tricky
      when grandma would _normally_ post family photos, but if grandma is
      currently a kinship caregiver, she cannot post those photos without
      permission from the child's parent(s).

      * Instead of posting photos of youth online, such as in galleries of youth available for adoption, use images of concepts and items that are representative of that child, such as horses or art supplies. Adoption websites are not catalogs.

      * Make it explicitly clear to families that covering a child's face with an emoji or other shape is not sufficient; they cannot post images online at all.

      * Use private technology tools to enable (and encourage!) sharing of photos and other information between foster families and the child's famil of origin. Keep this material off social media.

      * If workers see inappropriate photos posted on social media, encourage them to reach out gently but firmly to remind families of  privacy rules. It has become a trend to post images of children in care with funny emojis covering their faces, which may give families a false impression that this behavior is allowed.

    about: When the licensing workers who interact with and really know a family get

      for relatives, everyone benefits. A supervisor or area administrator who
      has never met a family is often not the best person to make a judgement

      and higher licensing rates for relatives.
    how: >-
      * Review your exception approval process. Consider removing some or all
      higher approval steps. If this is too drastic a shift, start with making a

    about: Title IV-E of the Social Security Act, which governs foster care
      maintenance payments and licensing, specifically says that states can make
      exceptions to any "non-safety" licensing requirements for relatives. Most
      states have artificially limited their flexibility around exceptions — but
      you can fix this by following in the footsteps of states that have maximum
      flexibility.
    how: >-
      * Borrow policy verbiage from states with maximum flexibility to grant
      exceptions to relatives. The only licensing requirements that are "safety"
      issues are those that would prevent placement (such as a disqualifying
      criminal history). Here's the law, so you can easily reference it: "(D)
      that a waiver of any standards established pursuant to subparagraph (A)
      may be made only on a case- by-case basis for non-safety standards (as
      determined by the State) in relative foster family homes for specific
      children in care."  

      * If you currently allow _some_ exceptions, change this to allow all non-safety issues. Do not have a specific list of relative exceptions. 

      * If you don't currently allow any licensing exceptions for relatives, start! Use states that already have this flexibility, listed below, as a guide (and feel free to reach out to us for help). 

      * Carefully define "safety" and "non-safety." This trips up many systems. If a kinship caregiver is safe enough to place, then by definition, any other issues are non-safety issues. A safety issue is only something that would cause you to immediately remove a child from that person's care. Under this definition, **ALL** kinship caregivers with placement should qualify for a license. 

      * Acknowledge there will be a small handful of exceptions. You may have a kinship caregiver with a disqualifying federal criminal history but is a court-ordered placement. In this case, the caregiver won't be eligible for IV-E reimbursement. But this should be an extremely rare situation.

    about: No matter how many hours of training they've had, it's a different
      experience once a child is placed in your home. This is particularly the
      case for kinship caregivers who may have had no notice their life was
      about to change. A little extra support during this transition period can
      go a long way towards making a placement successful and retaining foster
      homes for the long term.
    how: >-
      * Update your practices to include regular check-ins with resource
      families after they take their first placement. The specific person who
      should check in may vary by agency, but it should be a consistent person.
      Kinship caregivers should also get these calls. Milestones might include
      the first night, right before any key meetings, the first day a child
      attends school (if different from the first day of placement), and at
      least once a week for the first month.

      * Ask open-ended questions. How's it going? Do they need anything? Do they have any questions? This is a great opportunity to identify any additional supports that may be needed and get them in place proactively.

      it can be easy to assume that no news is good news in the case of your

      families altogether.
    how: >-

      check-in should capture what they learn on a structured form for internal
      analysis and reporting.

      * Make it as easy as possible for families to participate in check-ins. Work around their schedule, provide childcare, offer different meeeting options (in-person coffee or video chat or phone call).

      * Incorporate check-ins with existing meetings. If you have a worker going to do a home visit anyway, make it a practice for them to talk to the caregiver privately about how they're doing and whether they have questions or unmet needs. The worker should capture this information and there should be clear steps for follow-up.

      * Develop an agency practice for evaluating all check-in information at a regular cadence (such as quarterly or every six months) to look for high-level trends or themes that may indicate the need for new programs or supports, or changes. Sort information by area and by worker if you are in a larger system. You don't need a data scientist to spot problems.

  - heading: Measure retention carefully
    costs:
      - None
    about: The percentage of families that your system retains as resource parents
      can be a misleading number if not tracked carefully. There are plenty of
      good, or at least neutral, reasons for a family closing its beds, such as
      adopting their current placement, moving out of state, or perhaps reaching
      a certain age. There are also some families for whom fostering is just not
      a good fit, and it's best for them and for children in care that they part
      ways with your agency. Retention goals should focus on families willing
      and able to meet the needs of children in care, but who drop out due to
      frustration or burnout—and this starts by being able to measure and
      differentiate how you're performing with those families.
    how: >-
      * Formally capture when a family stops serving as a resource family. This
      might be when their license expires, when they submit a letter of
      termination, or when a kinship placement ends. If you do not have such
      clear milestones, come up with one, such as "has not taken a placement in
      over 12 months."

      * Capture the reason when caregivers close their license in your IT system. While all their answers won't necessarily be honest (it's hard to capture "they quit because they hated their worker" in a note), it's a start.

      * Differentiate between reasons that could have been avoided with agency action, and those that could not. Focus your efforts only on the former.

        in its [written policy](LINK TO COLLEEN).

        * **Michigan** connects resource parents of separated children at the start of placements and encouraged to set up additional visits.

        * **Frederick County, MD** introduces all resource parents of separated sibling groups, encourages an ongoing relationship between resource parents, especially if one resource parent is a kinship caregiver and the other is not.

        * **Oklahoma** encourages resource parents with separated siblings to bring the children together as often as possible.

        * **New Hampshire** promotes natural collaboration between parents and resource parents. 

        * **Washington DC**’s social worker team ensures resource parents understand the expectation for sibling visits and that the Agency supports this practice; in all, it’s a collected effort with the entire team. BOND Leads create activities where siblings who are separated can engage across Squad members (resource parents). Resource Parent Support Workers ensure families have connections and opportunities to get siblings together on their own as well.

  - heading: Provide transportation for sibling visits
    costs:
      - Varies
    about: Transportation can often be the biggest barrier to sibling visits.
      Providing options, especially for younger children who can't navigate cabs
      or public transit on their own, can mean more and easier sibling visits.
    how: >-
      * Provide taxi, ride sharing, and/or public transit fares for older youth
      who can use this transit on their own.

      * Investigate transportation options for younger youth such as dedicated Department employees, Department-run transportation services, or third-party services like [HopSkipDrive](https://www.hopskipdrive.com).

        * **Fairfax County, VA** has multiple options for transporting youth to
        visit their siblings. If a youth is 13 or older, the agency provides
        funding for a taxi cab. For infants, younger children, and/or children
        with higher levels of need, the Department runs a program called MV with
        trained, background-checked drivers who can provide transportation.
        Fairfax County also uses [HopSkipDrive](https://www.hopskipdrive.com). 

        * **Nebraska** expects resource parents to provide transport for visits within 25 miles. It also has a number of contracted transportation providers who must have background checks, and potentially has taxis available for older youth.

        * **New Hampshire** has a Safe Passage transportation program that can be used for sibling transport. 

        * **Frederick County, MD** has the ability to use taxi cabs to transport older children to sibling visits.

  - heading: Remove barriers for contact with familiar adult siblings
    costs:
      - None
    about: Adult siblings (who have existing relationships with their younger
      siblings) should not have to jump through hoops for visits. This is
      especially true for siblings who are only just now aging out of foster
      care themselves.
    how: >-
      * Examine whether your system has barriers, like court petitions,
      background checks, or social worker sign-off, to familiar adult siblings
      setting up visits. (It is acceptable for some evaluation, like a
      background check, if the adult sibling is unknown to the sibling or the
      case, but now wants to be involved.)

      * Leverage prudent parenting guidance to encourage visits with familiar adult siblings without Departmental involvement.

        * **Frederick County, MD** requires separated siblings to have contact
        at least monthly [per policy](/assets/SSA 15-18 Parent-Child and Sibling
        Visitation.pdf), and explicitly forbids withholding sibling visits as a
        form of discipline.   

        * **Indiana** requires at least two sibling visits per month. 

        * **Michigan** requires a minimum of a one hour visit per month.

        * **Oklahoma** has a policy requiring ongoing efforts to keep siblings connected: Oklahoma's policy: (d) Child's contact with siblings. Per Section 471(a)(31) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 671(a)(31)), 10A O.S. §§1-4-807 and 1-4-811, and Oklahoma Administrative Code 340:75-6-85, DHS makes ongoing reasonable efforts to place sibling groups together in both temporary and permanent placements. When joint placement of siblings is unsafe or contrary to the child's well-being, DHS must justify and document the justification for the decision, make monthly efforts to resolve the barriers to joint placement, provide frequent visitation, and arrange for ongoing interaction. Frequent contact, such as face-to-face visitation, phone calls, email, social media, or mail contact between siblings is arranged. DHS must make efforts to resolve barriers to joint placement and visitation a minimum of once a month. 

        * **Washington** has a robust policy:

          * Children placed apart from their siblings will have two or more face-to-face visits or contacts per month, unless there is an approved exception, as listed in Procedures Section 4. Additional approved forms of sibling contact are encouraged to support and maintain sibling relationships. Approved forms of contact include, but are not limited to: Telephone contact; Electronic contact through video chat or email.

          * Ongoing visitation is encouraged to promote and maintain the continuity of sibling relationships that existed prior to placement. This includes siblings who: Remained in the home at the time of removal; Aged out of foster care; Returned home; Are placed with a non-custodial parent; or Lived part-time in the home at the time of the sibling’s removal.
          * Sibling contact during family time meets the requirement for a sibling visit.
          * Shared planning meetings or court events do not meet the requirement for a sibling visit.
          * The first sibling visit must occur as soon as possible after placement.
          * Sibling visits will continue after a parent’s rights are terminated or relinquished unless an approved exception applies.
          * Sibling visits cannot be limited or used as a sanction for a child’s behavior or as an incentive to change a child’s behavior.
          * Sibling visit plans will be developed within 14 calendar days and in consultation with the out-of-home caregiver and child, when developmentally appropriate, unless an approved exception applies.

    inspiration: California's code
    about: When siblings are separated in foster care and then one or more of them
      are adopted, it can be even greater trauma if adoptive parents cut off
      contact with their siblings. It should be possible to include ongoing
      sibling visitation, same as open adoptions can allow for visits with birth
      parents. When siblings are old enough, they will find one another again --
      why allow for gaps in that connection?
